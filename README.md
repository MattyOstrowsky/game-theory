## General info
Game theory is the study of mathematical models of
strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. there are scripts with implemented selected algorithms from game theory.
## Installation

1. Git clone repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gunater/game-theory.git
```
2. Install the necessary python dependencies you can use `pipenv`:
```bash
$ pipenv install
$ piipenv shell
```
or you can install from requirements.txt with `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to run it
### 1. Algorithm Horn-Sidney
To run the script, go to the main directory:
```bash
$ cd Algorithm\ Horn\ Sidney/

```
and then run script with:
```bash
$ python3 algorytmHS.py
```
### 2. Decision-making theory
To run the script, go to the main directory:
```bash
$ cd decision\ making\ theory/
```
and then run script with:
```bash
$ cd decision\ making\ theory/
$ python3 main.py
```
### 3. Dynamic programming
To run the script, go to the main directory:
```bash
$ cd Dynamic\ programming/
```
and then run script with:
```bash
$ python3 algorithm.py
```
### 4. Netowork programming
To run the script, go to the main directory:
```bash
$ cd Netowork\ programming/
```
and then run script with:
```bash
$ python3 tree.py
```
### 5. Zero sum two player game
To run the script, go to the main directory:
```bash
$ cd cd Zero\ sum\ two\ player\ game/

```
and then run script with:
```bash
$ python3 game.py
```
